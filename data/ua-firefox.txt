Notice - this article is for the Techies!

   The information on this page is of a more technical nature, and might not be what you're after. You only need the info here if you really know what you're doing.

   Please note that these are very "stock-standard" Firefox user agents and certainly don't reflect the wide variety of possible Firefox user agents that exist today. These user agents don't show anyextra addons, network providers or anything
   else customised or particular; these are just the standard user agents.

   Explore our huge user agent listing, download our user agents database, (or you can search it) if you're curious about other user agents.

Special notes

  Major release version numbers only

   For a while now, Firefox's user agent has only included the "major release" version number in the user agent; so while a copy of Firefox might actually be version 61.0.2, it would only be reported as version "61.0" in the user agent.

  Experiment with different user agents

   You can use our User Agent Parser page to try out different user agent varieties, or to test if your user agent switcher is working properly.

Database of user agents

   If you're interested in our database of many millions of user agents, please check out our API which provides access to our user agent database. You can perform very detailed and specific queries on it to find user agents that match your
   exact criteria - version numbers, hardware types, platforms and so on.
